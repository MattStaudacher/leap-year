## About

Leap Year
Follow along with the leap year lessons to build an application that identifies whether a given year is a leap year. Make each of the specs detailed in the leap year lessons "pass" (ie: your program returns the expected output for the expected input).

Specs from Leap Year Lessons
The program should return when a year is not a leap year.
Input Example: 1993
Output Example: false
The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.
Input Example: 2004
Output Example: true
The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.
Input Example: 1900
Output Example: false
The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years.
Input Example: 2000
Output Example: true
